# QSAR Modeling Tools

Welcome to the QSAR Modeling GitHub repository! This repository contains a collection of useful tools for Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) modeling. Whether you're a chemist, biologist, or data scientist, these tools will assist you in building and analyzing predictive models for chemical and biological activities. Below are the tools that have been added to this repository:

## Tools Included

### 1. Feature Selection in Python

- Folder: `feature_selection_python/`
- Description: This toolset provides Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for feature selection in QSAR modeling. Feature selection is a crucial step in building robust predictive models. These scripts implement various feature selection algorithms and techniques to help you choose the most relevant features for your modeling tasks.

### 2. Feature Selection in R

- File: `feature_selection_r/`
- Description: Similar to the Python version, this toolset focuses on feature selection techniques implemented in R. If you're more comfortable with R programming, these scripts and examples will guide you through the process of feature selection for your QSAR models.

### 3. Convert 2D Chemical Structures from SMILES

- File: `convert_2d_structures_from_SMILES/`
- Description: This tool enables the conversion of Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) strings into 2D chemical structures. It utilizes cheminformatics libraries and algorithms to visualize the chemical structures corresponding to the provided SMILES notation.

### 4. Create SMILES for Chemical Compounds in Python

- Folder: `create_smiles_python/`
- Description: In this section, you'll find Python scripts and examples for generating SMILES representations of chemical compounds. SMILES strings are concise textual notations that represent the structure of molecules. These scripts demonstrate how to create SMILES for various chemical compounds using computational methods.

## Usage

Each tool's folder contains detailed usage instructions, examples, and documentation. Feel free to explore the respective folders and utilize the scripts and notebooks as needed for your QSAR modeling projects.
